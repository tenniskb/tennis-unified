**How statistically effective is playing the net really?**

Is playing the net more effective than staying at the baseline? The
simplest method to answer this question is to compare win probabilities
at the net versus at the baseline.

In the final section of his brilliant article on the New Magic Numbers,
Craig O\'Shannessy reports that players won 65% of their approaches in
his studies at the U.S. Open, and that this percentage was almost as
high at every level, from 12 and unders up through college tennis.

However, my research shows this method is insufficient to make a truly
accurate determination. Why? Because win probabilities at net can be
deceptively high.

When using statistics to determine the effectiveness of playing the net,
it\'s essential to account for other relevant variables\--not just win
probabilities. For instance, many approach shots are hit off easy balls,
which give you an advantage in winning the point irrespective of whether
you approach the net or not.

Suppose you serve four points. Twice, the returner floats the return,
and you approach the net and put away easy volleys. But the other two
points, the returner hammers the return and forces you to play defense.

You lose one of those two points, but you grind out the other one. The
result is you end up with a 100% win probability at net and a 50% win
probability at the baseline. On the surface, that suggests that playing
the net was more effective than staying back.

**What do the raw numbers on approaches really mean?**

But in the case of the two floating returns, the act of playing the net
was not necessarily in and of itself the reason for your higher win
probability. In fact, had you stayed back on all four points, you
probably would have still won three of them because of the floated
returns.

And if you had come to net on the two points following a strong return,
you probably would have lost both of them due to the lack of an
opportunity to hit a quality approach shot. So in our hypothetical
example, coming to net more often would not have helped you win more
points and may have even cost you one or both of the points you won at
the baseline.

The point is there are variables other than simply approaching the net
that affect win probabilities. In our example, whether the hypothetical
returner floated or hammered the return.

**Confounders**

I call these variables Confounders. My research shows it\'s impossible
to analyze the impact of playing the net separately from the impact of
Confounders.

So how do you really assess the effectiveness of going to the net?
Through a statistical technique called Regression Analysis. Using
Regression Analysis I can account for the Confounders and quantify the
true impact of playing the net more accurately.

**The return is short and centered, so Rafael Nadal approaches the net
and puts away a volley.**

To demonstrate how Regression Analysis works, I analyzed the 2016
Wimbledon men\'s final, in which Andy Murray defeated Milos Raonic 6-4,
7-6, 7-6. Just one match played a surface conducive to net play, but the
results are suggestive and I believe would be widely confirmed by
additional analysis.

What I found was that the characteristics of each incoming ball hit to
the player by the opponent affected the players\' win probabilities. To
show this I treated every shot\--rather than every point\--as a separate
event.

Excluding the serve and return, I looked at every rally shot in which
both players were on the baseline. For purposes of simplicity, I also
excluded serve and volley points which are a separate category with its
own set of complex variables.

In looking only at the baseline points, I considered 5 variables.

1.  **Who won the point.**

2.  **Whether there was an approach.**

3.  **Whether the incoming ball was short landing inside the service
    line.**

4.  **Whether the incoming ball landed in the center of the court.**

5.  **And whether the incoming ball was defensive, meaning floated or
    lobbed.**

The results are in Table 1. Win in the table means the player ultimately
wins the point. Approach defines whether the player hit an approach
shot. Short means the incoming ball landed inside the service line.
Centered means the incoming ball landed in the middle third of the
court. Defensive means the incoming ball was floated or lobbed.

In my analysis, these 4 variables\--Approach, Short, Centered, and
Defensive\--are all independent variables. Win is the dependent
variable. For the purposes of assessing the effectiveness of net play,
Approach is the independent variable of interest. The other 3
independent variables are the Confounders.

**Players can win points on Confounders on groundstrokes as well as on
volleys.**

Intuitively we know, pros often approach the net on short, centered, or
defensive balls. But they often win the point on these balls regardless
of whether they approach the net or not. So not accounting for these
Confounders may make approaching seem more effective than it actually
is.

This is because winning the point on a Confounder can happen either at
the net or on a groundstroke. Therefore the act of going to net in and
of itself is not the necessary reason a player wins the point. It\'s
more a matter of the incoming ball.

Let\'s see how this played out in the Wimbledon final between Murray and
Raoinc. Let\'s look at total points won in baseline rallies, again
excluding serve and return.

Murray won104 of these baseline points and lost 81. Raonic won 98 but
lost 108. Murray approached on 17 of these baseline points. Raonic
approached much more often, as you would expect from him, coming in off
baseline rallies 51 times. The results are shown below in Table 1.

For each player, my goal was to compare the apparent impact of these
approaches on who won the point. First when I don\'t account for the
Confounders, and then when I do. If the impact of the approaches is more
positive when I don\'t account for the Confounders and less positive
when I do, then the Confounders are inflating the win probability
associated with approaching.

To find out the answer, I run what are called Regressions with and
without the Confounders for each player. In these Regressions, each
independent variable has its own estimated impact on the dependent
variable\--who won the point.

**I found that Confounders inflated the win probability associated with
approaching.**

Quantifying the success of approaches without accounting for the
Confounders is the same as calculating raw win probabilities the way
Craig O\'Shannessy does. But the Regressions account for the effect of
the Confounders, that is, the balls that were short, centered or
defensive.

In Table 2, I present the results of all four Regressions; each
Regression is in its own column. The first two regressions are for
Murray, and the last two are for Raonic.

For each player, the regression titled No Confounders lacks the
Confounders, whereas the one titled Confounders contains them. Also, for
each Regression, each number in the table quantifies the impact of the
corresponding variable on Win. As a hypothetical example, if the number
corresponding to the variable Approach is 25.0%, then approaching is
25.0% more effective than staying back.

Finally, all four Regressions contain a term called Constant. In the
Regressions without the Confounders, Constant is the player\'s win
probability when he stays back. To calculate his win probability when he
approaches, just add Approach and Constant.

Now the Regressions with Confounders. Constant is still the player\'s
win probability when he stays back and the incoming ball is neither
short nor centered nor defensive.

To find his win probability when he approaches, and the incoming ball is
short but not centered or defensive add Constant, Approach and Short.And
the same for the other Confounders/ For more on the math of all this,
check out the analysis on my website. ([Click

What did I find? Per Table 2, without accounting for the Confounders,
Murray\'s raw win probability was 35.3% higher when approaching the net
than when staying back. His raw win probabilities were 53.0% when
staying back and 88.3% when approaching However, when I account for the
Confounders, it turns out that approaching benefited him by only 22.2%.
So not accounting for Confounders did deceptively inflate his win
probability when approaching.

**The depth of Nadal\'s slice backhand makes the subsequent approach
less effective, resulting in a passing shot.**

In comparison, Raonic\'s raw win probability was 22.8% higher when
approaching than when staying back, 41.9% when staying back and 64.7%
when approaching. When accounting for the Confounders, approaching was
only 16.4% more effective than staying back. So the true benefit of
approaching for Raonic was closer to 16.4% than 22.8%.

**Conclusion**

In summary, while Murray and Raonic were generally both better off when
approaching, failing to account for the Confounders makes approaching
seem more effective than it actually was. Without Regression Analysis,
it wouldn\'t be possible to draw this conclusion.

In this match all 17 of Murray\'s approaches had one or more
Confounders. Of Raonic\'s 51 approaches, 46 were the same---one or more
Confounders. Interestingly, though not statistically significant, of
Raonic\'s 6 approaches without a Confounder he won 2 points and lost 4.

No doubt playing the net can be an effective tactic. Despite the
Confounders making approaching seem more effective, approaching still
had a positive impact for both Murray and Raonic.

But, as noted, this was just one match, and one played on grass. So
obviously a lot more data would be necessary to analyze the overall
effectiveness of net play on the Tour or at other levels. In fact, there
may be players who have high win probabilities at net but should
approach less often than they do.

But Regression Analysis is useful for analyzing more than just
approaches. It can help quantify the effectiveness of any tactic subject
to Confounders. I\'ve found in other match analyses that some offensive
tactics also have deceptively high win probabilities. Swinging volleys,
for one, are often winners since they\'re hit off floaters and/or close
to the net. But that doesn\'t necessarily mean you should swing at a
greater percentage of your volleys.

Lastly, regression analysis is useful for analyzing more than just
playing the net. That is, it can help quantify the effectiveness of any
tactic subject to confounders.

For instance, I\'ve found in other match analyses that offensive tactics
generally have deceptively high win probabilities. Relative to
traditional volleys, swinging volleys, for one, are often winners since
they\'re hit off floaters. But that doesn\'t mean you should swing at a
greater percentage of your volleys.

In contrast, defensive tactics, such as slice lobs, tend to have
deceptively low win probabilities. But just because slice lobs don\'t
usually win you the point doesn\'t mean you shouldn\'t hit them when you
don\'t have better options. Ultimately, with more data and careful
interpretation of that data, pros and all players could better
understand which tactics are most effective for their game.
